## Part 1: index.html

In this exercise, you will create a simple web document about yourself.
1. Create a new HTML document called index.html in your text editor.
2. Provide the standard HTML5 tags.
3. Create the page title for the `<title>` tags (e.g. My Profile)
4. Create a `<header>` tag
5. In the <header> tag, include an image of yourself or a logo of your choosing. You can use any
image you currently own or download something free from the internet.
6. Include a motto, word, or phrase about the page (see my sample below)
7. Create a top navigation menu using the `<nav>` tags and include links to these pages: about.html,
contact.html, portfolio.html
These are just placeholders and creating them is not required. The navigation links should be
created using the unorder list element (e.g. `<ul>`…`</ul>`).
8. In the `<main>` section of your document, include one or two paragraphs about your page.
9. In a new `<section>`, create a video element and use the link of one of the videos found here or one of your own:
  <a href="http://apollo.gtc.edu/~hurc/152-182/video/" target="_blank">http://apollo.gtc.edu/~hurc/152-182/video/</a>
10. Create an audio element and link to a sample video file found here or one of your own:
<a href="http://apollo.gtc.edu/~hurc/152-182/podcast/" target="_blank">http://apollo.gtc.edu/~hurc/152-182/podcast/</a>
11. Outside of the `<main>` tag, provide a footer section for your page. It should include common
content such as copyright date, text, etc.
12. Save the document
13. Open the `index.html` file on your Web browser. Your page should look plain and simple like my
sample below.

## Part 2:  main.css
In this exercise, you will style the `index.html` file in Part 1 using CSS.
1. Create and save a CSS stylesheet called `main.css` in your text editor.
2. Link this external stylesheet to your index.html file in Part 1.
3. Look at the sample screen shot below and code your CSS stylesheet to give format your site.
4. The logo/image is floated left and the motto is floated right
5. The navigation menu has a grey background color and the links are centered
6. Style the `<ul>` to remove the default bullet points
7. Style the `<li>` to display an inline-block and give some margins around them
8. Style the `<a>` tags to remove the underline display
9. Give a default color to the link (e.g. always stays blue)
10. When you hover over the link it should change to a different color other than the default (e.g.
red)
11. Give the footer a background color and center the text
12. Save the document
13. Open the `index.html` file on your Web browser. Verify that the result has applied to the index
page. Yours could be different and it doesn't have to match mine.
  
## Part 3. main.js
In this exercise, you will create a JavaScript file to provide interactions with the index.html page. We’re
going to create just a simple event to show and hide the multimedia content using JavaScript.

1. Create a new JavaScript file called `main.js` in your text editor.
2. Link this external script to the head section of your HTML page.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your text editor
4. Under the Multimedia Content, create two buttons: Show and Hide
5. Wrap these two buttons in a `<div>` tag and style the buttons to give them margins round and
enlarge the font size. Here’s a sample of what they may look like this:
6. Provide an “id” attribute for the `<video>` and `<audio>` tags. We’ll use the “id” in JavaScript to
show and hide their content.
7. Now, open the `main.js` file and write the functions and statements to show and hide both the
video and podcast when the buttons are clicked.
8. Save the document.
9. Open the index.html file in your Web browser. Verify that the buttons work as expected.
Correct any errors if necessary.
